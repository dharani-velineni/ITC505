        <h2>Addendum: Process and Challenges</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> The game was developed by first creating the core mechanics to toggle the lights and check for a win condition. A randomized but solvable configuration was achieved by starting with an all-on board and applying a set number of random toggles. Features like move counting, timing, and visual/sound embellishments were added to enhance user experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The primary challenge was ensuring that the randomized board was always solvable. This was solved by simulating random toggles on an all-on board. Implementing a responsive design for different devices and ensuring the timer didn't interfere with game performance also required careful adjustments.</p>

        <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Simple, responsive UI design greatly improves player satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Small embellishments, such as sounds and animations, significantly enhance engagement.</li>
                <li>Testing and iterating on the design helped refine both functionality and aesthetics.</li>
            </ul>
