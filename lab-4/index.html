            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Shakespeare’s tragedies often explore themes of fate, morality, and human suffering. In <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, and <em>Othello</em>, the downfall of noble characters occurs due to their fatal flaws and external pressures. This paper explores these tragic elements with specific reference to Hamlet’s indecision, Macbeth’s ambition, and Othello’s jealousy.</p>

            <h2>Body</h2>
            <p>Shakespeare’s understanding of tragedy is rooted in classical models, but his characters are deeply human and relatable. In <em>Hamlet</em>, for example, the protagonist's fatal flaw is his indecision, as is evident when he says:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune..."<br>
                (<em>Hamlet</em>, 3.1.55-60)
            </blockquote>

            <p>This soliloquy reflects Hamlet's internal struggle between action and inaction, a theme that recurs throughout the play. In contrast, Macbeth's tragedy stems from his overreaching ambition. Encouraged by the witches’ prophecy, Macbeth muses:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I have no spur<br>
                To prick the sides of my intent, but only<br>
                Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself<br>
                And falls on the other."<br>
                (<em>Macbeth</em>, 1.7.25-28)
            </blockquote>

            <p>This ambition drives Macbeth to murder King Duncan, leading to his ultimate downfall. Similarly, in <em>Othello</em>, jealousy becomes the tragic flaw. Othello’s overwhelming jealousy, fueled by Iago's manipulation, drives him to murder his innocent wife, Desdemona.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In these plays, Shakespeare masterfully combines internal character flaws with external circumstances to create compelling tragedies. The tragic outcomes are inevitable once the characters give in to their flaws.</p>

    <!-- Second Article: Addendum -->
    <article>
        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In this project, I made several stylistic choices to enhance the readability and aesthetics of the webpage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I chose 'Georgia' for its elegant serif style, which complements the literary theme of the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is set at 2.5em for the title to ensure it stands out prominently, while the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags at 2em maintain a clear hierarchy and are visually distinct.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> A cohesive color palette was employed, featuring a soothing blue accent for headings and borders, with dark grey for body text to ensure readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin and Padding:</strong> Generous margins and padding enhance whitespace, making the text easier to read and visually appealing. Headings have extra padding to give them room to breathe, and paragraphs are justified for a polished look.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockquote Styling:</strong> Blockquotes have a border and shadow for depth, emphasizing quotes while keeping them visually distinct from the main text.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p>In my initial HTML structure, I had incorrectly used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for the main title to achieve a certain look. This was corrected to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, ensuring the document structure reflects proper semantic meaning.</p>
