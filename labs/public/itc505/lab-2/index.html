            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Shakespeare’s tragedies often explore themes of fate, morality, and human suffering. In <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, and <em>Othello</em>, the downfall of noble characters occurs due to their fatal flaws and external pressures. This paper explores these tragic elements with specific reference to Hamlet’s indecision, Macbeth’s ambition, and Othello’s jealousy.</p>

            <h2>Body</h2>
            <p>Shakespeare’s understanding of tragedy is rooted in classical models, but his characters are deeply human and relatable. In <em>Hamlet</em>, for example, the protagonist's fatal flaw is his indecision, as is evident when he says:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune..."<br>
                (<em>Hamlet</em>, 3.1.55-60)
            </blockquote>

            <p>This soliloquy reflects Hamlet's internal struggle between action and inaction, a theme that recurs throughout the play. In contrast, Macbeth's tragedy stems from his overreaching ambition. Encouraged by the witches’ prophecy, Macbeth muses:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I have no spur<br>
                To prick the sides of my intent, but only<br>
                Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself<br>
                And falls on the other."<br>
                (<em>Macbeth</em>, 1.7.25-28)
            </blockquote>

            <p>This ambition drives Macbeth to murder King Duncan, leading to his ultimate downfall. Similarly, in <em>Othello</em>, jealousy becomes the tragic flaw. Othello’s overwhelming jealousy, fueled by Iago's manipulation, drives him to murder his innocent wife, Desdemona.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In these plays, Shakespeare masterfully combines internal character flaws with external circumstances to create compelling tragedies. The tragic outcomes are inevitable once the characters give in to their flaws.</p>
